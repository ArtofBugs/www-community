High-profile breaches, such as 3CX's compromised CI/CD pipeline\u2014where the North Korean Lazarus Group injected malicious code into widely used apps\u2014the JetBrains TeamCity exploit, where Russian state-sponsored actors gained unauthorized admin control without user interaction, and Sisense's exposure of critical credentials through unsecured GitLab repositories, highlight alarming vulnerabilities in development workflows.\nWe'll explore how these threat actors exploit flaws in CI/CD processes. Drawing on CloudNative's experience, we'll provide strategies to strengthen your DevOps pipeline without sacrificing agility.\u201d\n\n**19:55 \u2013 20:10** \\- Network break with coffee\\, tea\\, water and snacks\\.\n\n**20:10 \u2013 20:55** \\- \"Bring diversity and inclusion to tech\" by Lise Lystlund\n\n\"The tech community excels at knowledge sharing and supporting one another. Without hesitation, people from across the globe dedicate time to help others solve coding problems. To me, this reflects a welcoming and collaborative community that anyone would want to be a part of. Tech is also an appealing field, offering numerous workplace benefits and opportunities for growth. Yet, despite these advantages, the industry continues to struggle with attracting women. How is it that a group representing 50% of the population remains so underrepresented in tech\u2014and, more importantly, what can we do to change this?\"\n\n**20:55 \u2013 21:00** \\- Closing Remarks by OWASP Aarhus and Cloud Native"

        "description": "We're excited to announce our upcoming October meetup in conjunction with **Pacific Hackers**, which will be hosted by the awesome **Backslash** team at **Hacker Dojo in Sunnyvale**. Get ready for insightful discussions and the chance to network with some of the brightest minds in the industry.\n**Agenda:**\n5:30 - 6:00: Doors open, networking and food\n6:00 - 6:45: Panel discussion: **AppSec vs AppSec: Compliance-Driven Security vs. Real World Risk-Focused Innovation**\n6:45 - 7:30: **From Flat 2D to Full-Dimensional 3D: The Journey of AppSec**\n7:30-8:00: **Payment Page Security & Compliance 101**\n\n**Panel Discussion:** In today\u2019s rapidly evolving digital landscape, application security (AppSec) professionals are often torn between meeting compliance requirements and implementing security practices that genuinely reduce risk and foster innovation. This panel will explore the tension between two competing approaches: compliance-oriented AppSec, which focuses on ticking regulatory boxes, and real-world AppSec, which prioritizes proactive risk management and innovation to address dynamic threats.\nThrough lively discussion and real-world case studies, experts from diverse backgrounds will examine the impact of compliance-heavy frameworks on security outcomes. Does compliance help or hinder organizations in effectively mitigating risk? How can security teams balance the need to meet regulatory demands while adopting cutting-edge practices that drive meaningful security improvements? Join us to gain insight into how organizations can navigate these two competing forces, ensuring that both security and innovation thrive in the evolving threat landscape.\nModerator: Trupti Shiralkar\nPanelists: Kunal Bhattacharya , Sara A, Prashant KV\n\n**Talk1: From Flat 2D to Full-Dimensional 3D: The Journey of AppSec**\nRemember when AppSec was all about flagging everything? Back in the 90s, it was like looking at security in 2D\u2014find a vulnerability, flag it, and move on. But as applications grew more complex and moved to the cloud, this \u201cflag everything\u201d mindset became more of a hassle than a help. Modern apps are built differently, and with AI now writing code, there\u2019s more of it than ever before\u2014bringing new vulnerabilities along for the ride.\nToday, we need a 3D approach to AppSec. It\u2019s no longer just about spotting issues but understanding their context, reachability, and real impact. Modern architecture, cloud environments, open-source software (OSS), and the rise of AI-generated code have changed the game. We need smarter tools to handle this complexity. In this talk, we\u2019ll explore how AppSec has evolved from its humble beginnings to a dynamic, AI-aware discipline and the implications for security teams.\n**About the speaker:**\nWith a deep background in cybersecurity and cloud security, Eric Gold serves as Head AppSec Evangelist at Backslash Security. He played a pivotal role in building the evangelism efforts at Orca Security and Aqua Security. Eric has also advised startups like Panoply.io and ScyllaDB, and held executive sales roles at Couchbase, Aerospike, and DeviceScape.He began his career at Oracle and Sun Microsystems and holds a B.S. in Information and Decision Systems from Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nTalk2: **Payment Page Security & Compliance 101**\n**Abstract:** PCI DSS 4.0.1 has introduced new requirements\u20146.4.3 and 11.6.1\u2014to address concerns about card skimming activities on payment pages. This has become a hot topic, with experts debating the best approach to tackle these issues. In this talk, I'll guide you through all the technical approaches you can use to address these requirements. We'll explore the pros and cons of each method.\n\n**Speaker:** Sukesh is the Co-founder of Domdog.io. He specializes in data security and privacy for web pages. Prior to Domdog, most of his work focused on web application security research and building tools in this space."

Join us for networking with your peers and a featured talk from Dan Moore presenting:\n\n**Protecting your API with OAuth**\n\nOAuth is a well known standard and is useful for delegating authentication and authorization decisions to a central identity provider. As a developer, you\u2019ve given a token when a grant completes.\n\nBut what happens then? This talk will discuss client and server side code and logic needed when calling an API after you have a token. This will include how to store a token in the API client and what your API code should examine when presented with a token. discuss the building blocks for deploying a secure development process for detecting, remediating, and ultimately preventing security vulnerabilities in your software.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Rule4 Team for hosting and sponsoring, we couldn't do these events without our sponsors. If you're interested in sponsoring the #1 AppSec organization and our Boulder Chapter meetings, please reach out to alex.brown@owasp.org.\n\nPlease follow us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/owasp-boulder\n\nAnd join our Slack: https://join.slack.com/t/boulder-owasp/shared_invite/zt-2qnxnmmts-IQDaobNC1rcUbpaH1ip8Lg\n\n**AGENDA**\n6:00 - 6:30 Food, Drinks, Networking\n6:30 - 7:15ish Main Topic Presentation\n7:15ish - 7:30 Q&A and Discussion\n7:30 - 8:00 More Networking"

Registration required.**\n\n**This event will be live-streamed on YouTube.**\n\n**Recordings will be available on the OWASP London YouTube channel.**\n\n**Venue Location**: Civo Tech Junction, First Floor, 32-37 Cowper Street, London, EC2A 4AW\n**Nearest Tube:** Old Street (Northern Line), Cowper Street exit - 1 min walk\n**Doors Open at 6pm** for registration, pizza, drinks and networking. The talks start at 6:30pm (we start on time!).\n\n**TALKS:**\n\n**OWASP Introduction, Welcome and News** \\- Sam Stepanyan\\, Andra Lezza\\, Sherif Mansour \\- OWASP London Chapter Leaders\n\n**\"AI and AppSec: Are We Finally on the Verge of the Big Breakthrough?\"** - **Petra Vukmirovi\u0107**\n\nIn cybersecurity, AI has made significant advances, especially in threat detection, risk quantification, and remediation automation. However, in Application Security (AppSec), it hasn\u2019t fully reached its potential\u2014yet.\nThis talk will explore why the next big breakthrough in AI is poised to revolutionize threat modeling and security reviews, areas traditionally plagued by manual processes, high complexity, and slow adoption in fast-moving development environments.\nWe are at the tipping point where AI can understand code deeply enough to automate threat modeling, shifting it left and removing bottlenecks in the security review process. By using AI to derive data flows, identify threats and controls, and continuously update threat models, we can potentially integrate security into the development lifecycle more effectively.\nJoin this session to discuss and discover how AI could potentially take threat modeling as code (and from code!) to the next level.\n\n\"**Proactive Risk Detection at the Design Stage\" - Ella Bor**\n\nSecurity risks can be costly when discovered late in development, and the \u201cshift left\u201d movement seeks to address this. This talk explores strategies for identifying potential risks during the design phase, even before coding begins. By analyzing ticketing systems with AI, development teams can identify potential risks such as insecure data handling or problematic third party integrations early on\u2014without slowing development velocity. The discussion will highlight methods to uncover design-phase risks while using AI to propose security review questions and automatically generate threat stories on a large scale. This approach not only simplifies the design review process but also helps prevent the creation of insecure code.\n\n**Guest Talk - Speaker TBC**\n\n**RAFFLE - win a prize kindly donated by our sponsors!**\n\n**SPEAKERS:**\n\n**Petra Vukmirovi\u0107 (**[@PetraVuk1311](http://twitter.com/PetraVuk1311))\n\nTechnology enthusiast, leader, public speaker, believer in radical candor, ex-emergency medicine doctor, competitive athlete (volleyball) and ex-sports scholar. Petra started her cyber security career as a security engineer, climbed up the ladder to Director of Cyber Security. Love creating order out of chaos, learning and overcoming any challenges that come along my way. Always leveraging innovation and looking to implement improvements in processes and systems.\n\n**Ella Bor**\n\nElla Bor is an experienced data scientist, honed her skills across diverse industry domains, including legal-tech, e-commerce, and application security. At Apiiro, she harnesses her extensive expertise to drive innovation in application security. Ella specializes in leveraging artificial intelligence to tackle real-world challenges, developing and implementing end-to-end algorithmic solutions that automate complex tasks. Throughout her career, Ella has been dedicated to bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical application, ensuring that AI-driven solutions are both technically sound and aligned with business goals.\n\n**TICKETS:**\n\nOWASP meetups are free and open to anyone interested in application security.

Thank you to those that attended.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [YOI Indonesian Fusion](https://yoirestaurant.com.au/) as our location for next month. On 30th October 2024 6PM, there we shall meet.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get.\n\nWe're looking forward to the discussions we had once again.\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics. You are expected to participate in the AppSec/ProdSec conversations constructively if you attend. This isn't the right place for BizDev focused conversations.\n\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there."

This can turn up interesting results at different times.\nIn July 2024, FortiGuard Labs came across one such typosquatted domain, Fortiinet.com. The domain was registered a few months prior and did an excellent job impersonating our trade dress. In addition to being an excellent facsimile, the site was also dropping an infostealer, Lumma. The goal of this presentation is to detail the efforts we took to find and investigate the domain and infostealer.\n\n**Speaker bio:**\nWho Am I?\nI'm Canadian, eh!\nCurrently a Senior Threat Intel Engineer at Fortinet\nDay-to-day responsibility for looking for \"interesting samples\", reversing them and then passing the results on to our customers and government partners.\nPrior to Fortinet:\n8 years at NatWest as the Cyber Threat Hunting and Analytics Tech Lead\n10 years at BlackBerry as a Dev\nMy hobbies match my vocation. You can usually find me tinkering with malware or code that I stick up on GitHub - https://github.com/slaughterjames\n\n#### *Talk 2 \u2013 Global Insights from Security Leaders across the Globe*\n\n**Speaker:** James Walsh\n\n**Blurb:** Explanation of findings from Hays Global Cyber Survey, looking at Talent, AI, Cyber Budgets and Risks.\n\n**Speaker bio:**\nJames Walsh CISMP- Director of Cyber Security Practice UK&I has over 14 years of experience working specifically within the Cyber Security sector supporting a variety of industries with there Talent and Project Requirements.\n\n#### *Talk 3 \u2013 Cross-Site Scripting Beyond Alert(1)*\n\n**Speaker:** Paul Johnston\n\n**Blurb:** XSS is one of the most common web application vulnerabilities. Most proof-of-concept exploits simply display an alert box, proving that JavaScript code has been executed. This talk explores what an attacker can do beyond an alert box, to maliciously exploit an XSS flaw. We investigate how browser security features such as HttpOnly cookies and Content-Security-Policy can be bypassed, in certain circumstances. And we look some difficult XSS scenarios, that are not detected by leading scanners, but can be exploited with a carefully crafted payload.\n\n**Speaker bio:**\nPaul is a security consultant at Pentest, specialising in web applications, and particularly in securing cloud-native, multi-tenant, SaaS platforms. He has worked in security for a number of year, and previously was a software developer and sys-admin."

First up is Johan Persson from Consid, talking about:\n\n**Principles for Secure Development**\nIn this session Johan will provide a 45min overview of how a development team should think and work around security throughout the entire life cycle of system development. The presentation will go through things like security connected to development environments, code repos, pipelines, etc.\n\nJohan will be followed by Fredrik Klas\u00e9n from Snyk discussing:\n\n**Commonly Observed AI Security Issues While Using GenAI Tools in Software Development**\nFredrik will spend around 30 minutes discussing how AI-assisted coding increases your delivery speed and efficiency, but also bring risks. Fredrik will present an overview of AI in software development and commonly observed AI security issues while using GenAI tools to produce code and then exploit it. You\u2019ll also get an insight into strategies for mitigation of AI introduced threats.\n\nWe will start the evening with a mingle at 17:30 followed by the first presentation that will start at 18:00. After the first talk there will be a 5 min break followed by the second presentation. The second talk will be followed by a further mingle/time.

While a lot time is spent on evaluating prompt injection, there is an entire ecosystem of applications that allow models to be run and used. These applications have their own important security considerations that you may not be aware of.\nInference Servers are used to host machine learning models and expose APIs that allow other components to perform inference on those models. These servers often expose additional APIs that allow users to load new models. Often, this can be abused to perform remote code execution. While this technology is new, the baseline security configurations for many of these products are a relic from the past.\nIn this talk we\u2019ll learn about what an inference server is, how they work, and how you can achieve remote code execution in them. This talk is mainly focused on the practical security risks involved in this ecosystem. Finally, I will share details about a couple of CVEs related to TorchServe\n\n**Presenters:**\n\nPratik Amin has been an Application Security practitioner for over 15 years. He currently works as a Principal Security Consultant at Kroll (previously Security Compass Advisory). In this role, he spends most of his time performing AppSec pentests and digging into interesting technology."
